# Image Search Engine

Welcome to the Image Search Engine repository! This project contains the source code for an image search engine built with the help of the Unsplash API.

## Overview

The Image Search Engine allows users to search for images based on their queries. Leveraging the power of the Unsplash API, the search engine retrieves high-quality images matching the user's search terms and displays them in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Files

- **imagesAi.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the image search engine.
- **imagesAi.css**: Contains the CSS styles for styling the image search engine.
- **imagesAi.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for fetching and displaying images from the Unsplash API.

## Features

- **Image Search**: Users can enter keywords or phrases to search for images related to their interests.
- **Dynamic Image Display**: The search engine dynamically fetches and displays images from the Unsplash API based on the user's search query.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
